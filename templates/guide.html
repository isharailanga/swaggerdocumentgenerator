    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>WSO2 Open Banking provides the complete technology stack that you need to be fully Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) compliant and then rapidly digitize your business, easily integrate existing technology, and prepare for future implementations. It leverages five key technology areas critical to a banking infrastructure - API Management, Identity and Access Management, Integration, Data Analytics, and IoT.</p>
    <p>

        The REST API is implemented based on REST best practices and specifications as a CXF REST web application running on WSO2 Open Banking. API development is started with a swagger specification with a contract-first approach. The API comes with a pluggable security mechanism. Since API security is implemented as a CXF handler, if you need to plug a custom security mechanism, you can write your own handler and add it to the web service. </p>
